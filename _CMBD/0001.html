			<b>Trans Website</b> is designed and intended SOLELY for ADULTS -- people who are at least 18 years old -- who are interested in and wish to have access to verbal descriptions of a MILD sexually oriented nature.
			The materials which are available within this site may include graphic visual TRANSGENDERED, though MILD depictions and descriptions of TRANSGENDERED issues and should NOT be accessed by someone who is younger than 18 years old or who does not wish to be exposed to such materials.
			<br><br>
			By entering <b>Trans Website</b> you are making the following statements:
			<ul>
				<li>
					&quot;Under penalty of perjury, I swear/affirm that as of this moment, I am an adult, at least 18 years of age.&quot;
				<li>
					&quot;I promise that I will not permit any person(s) under 18 years of age to have access to any of the materials contained within <b>Trans Website</b>.&quot;
				<li>
					&quot;I understand that when I gain access to <b>Trans Website</b>, I may be exposed to visual TRANSGENDERED images and verbal descriptions of a MILD sexually oriented nature, which may include graphic visual depictions and descriptions of TRANSGENDERED issues. I am voluntarily choosing to do so, because I want to view and/or read the various materials which are available, for my own personal enjoyment, information and/or education.&quot;
				<li>
					&quot;My choice is a manifestation of my interest in sexual, TRANSGENDERED matters, which is both healthy and normal and, which, in my experience, is generally shared by average adults in my community.
					I am familiar with the standards in my community regarding the acceptance of such sexually oriented materials, and the materials I expect to encounter are within those standards.
					In my judgement, the average adult in my community accepts the consumption of such materials by willing adults in circumstances such as this which offer reasonable insulation from the materials for minors and unwilling adults and will not find such materials to appeal to a prurient interest or to be patently offensive.&quot;
